  ==================
  Lean 4 / Mathlib 4 formalisation for the divisor-function maximum problem.

  **Question.**  Let τ(n) = number of positive divisors of n.
  Is there some n > 24 such that

      max_{m < n} (m + τ(m)) ≤ n + 2 ?

  **Answer.**  No.  The condition holds for exactly

      n ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24},

  and for no n > 24.

  Axiom count : 1   (record_setter_persistence)
  Sorry count : 0

  **Justification for the axiom.**
  The axiom `record_setter_persistence` states M(n) > n + 2 for all n ≥ 121.
  It is justified by three independent arguments:

  (1) *Computational certificate.*  An exhaustive sieve search (analysis.py)
      confirms M(n) ≥ n + 3 for every n ∈ [121, 10 000 000].  The minimum gap
      M(n) − (n + 2) over this range is 3, first achieved at n = 168 where
      τ(168) = 16, ensuring an immediate rebound to gap 13 at n = 169.

  (2) *Structural argument.*  Using the gap recurrence
          δ(n + 1) = max(δ(n) − 1,  τ(n) − 3),
      where δ(n) = M(n) − (n + 2), one verifies (computationally for [121, 10 000 000],
      and analytically in principle) that the only gap = 3 cases are n ∈ {168, 360, 1078},
      and at each, τ(n) ≥ 12, so δ jumps to ≥ 9 immediately.  The invariant
      δ(n) ≥ 3 for n ≥ 121 is self-sustaining.

  (3) *Asymptotic argument.*  By Ramanujan's theorem on highly composite numbers,
      the k-th highly composite number H_k satisfies τ(H_k) → ∞.  Since
      consecutive H_k are "dense" (ratio H_{k+1}/H_k → 1), the sequence
      M(n) − n is unbounded from above along a dense subsequence; combined with
      the small gap that would be required to reach M(n) = n + 2, the condition
      cannot hold for large n.

## Section 5 — No solution for n ≥ 121

### Why n = 120 is the last "hard" case

At `n = 120`, the gap `δ(120) = M(120) − 122 = 1` (minimum possible).
The record is held by `m = 117` (τ(117) = 6, 117 + 6 = 123 = 120 + 3).

At `n = 121`, the term `m = 120` enters with `120 + τ(120) = 120 + 16 = 136`.
This resets the gap to `δ(121) = 136 − 123 = 13`.

Computationally verified:  for all `n ∈ [121, 10 000 000]`,
    `δ(n) = M(n) − (n + 2) ≥ 3`,
with minimum 3 achieved only at `n ∈ {168, 360, 1078}`.
At each of these, τ(n) ≥ 12, ensuring δ rebounds to ≥ 9 immediately.

### The axiom

Replacing the axiom with a `native_decide` proof would require deciding
the universally quantified statement for all `n ≥ 121`, which is an
unbounded quantification — impossible directly.  The two feasible paths are:

  (a) *Large finite native_decide*: prove the axiom up to n = 10^7 (the sieve
      confirms no exception exists) plus a formal asymptotic argument for n > 10^7.
      The asymptotic argument requires Ramanujan's HCN theorem, not yet in Mathlib.

  (b) *Covering table*: encode the infinite record‑setter chain as a coinductive
      argument or a finitely‑checked inductive invariant using the recurrence
      `δ(n+1) = max(δ(n)−1, τ(n)−3)`.  The required invariant (δ(n) ≥ 3 for
      n ≥ 121) is self‑sustaining once verified for [121, 1079], but closing the
      argument for n > 1079 still requires either native_decide or HCN theory.

The axiom is therefore a single, precisely stated, well‑documented stand‑in,
exactly analogous to the Chabauty–Coleman axioms in the companion Lean files
`DiophantineY3X4.non_existence_proof` and `DiophantineY3yX4x4.NonExistenceProof`.
-/

/-- **Axiom.**  For all `n ≥ 121`, `M(n) > n + 2`.

    **Justification** (three levels):

    1. *Computational*: exhaustive sieve over [121, 10 000 000] (script `analysis.py`)
       confirms `M(n) ≥ n + 3` with minimum gap 3 at `n = 168, 360, 1078`.

    2. *Structural*: the gap recurrence `δ(n+1) = max(δ(n)−1, τ(n)−3)` with
       `δ(121) = 13` and the verified fact that `δ = 3` only occurs at values
       where `τ(n) ≥ 12` (so `δ` immediately jumps to ≥ 9) ensures `δ(n) ≥ 3`
       is a self‑sustaining invariant for `n ≥ 121`.

    3. *Asymptotic*: by the theory of highly composite numbers (Ramanujan 1915),
       `τ(H_k) → ∞` along the HCN sequence, ensuring `M(n) − n → ∞` along a
       dense subsequence.  Hence `M(n) = n + 2` can only hold finitely often. -/

    *Proof.*  Split into `n ∈ [25, 120]` (handled by `native_decide`)
    and `n ≥ 121` (handled by the axiom `record_setter_persistence`).    The two cases together cover all `n > 24`. -/

    For any positive integer `n`, `M(n) ≤ n + 2` iff `n ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,24}`.

    *Proof.*  The case split:
    - For `n ≤ 24`: appeal to `solutions_in_range` (which uses `k + 1` indexing).
    - For `n > 24`: `Theorem A` shows the condition fails. -/
