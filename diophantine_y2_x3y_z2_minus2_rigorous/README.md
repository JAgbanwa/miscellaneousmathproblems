I formalised the paper *An Explicit Infinite Family of Integer Solutions to `y² + x³y + z² − 2 = 0`* in Lean 4 (with Mathlib). All results are fully proved — the project builds with no `sorry` and the main theorem depends only on the standard axioms (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`).
The formalisation lives in `RequestProject/Main.lean`, in namespace `DiophantineY2X3Y`, and follows the paper's construction:
- `cd`, `c`, `d`: the Pell-type sequence `(c₀,d₀) = (1,0)`, `cₙ₊₁ = 3cₙ+4dₙ`, `dₙ₊₁ = 2cₙ+3dₙ` (eq. 1.2), with the recurrences exposed as `c_succ`/`d_succ`.
- `a`, `R`, `S`, `xx`, `yy`, `zz`: the explicit auxiliary quantities and the constructed solution components (eq. 1.3). Since `xₙ = 4cₙdₙ`, the term `xₙ³/2` is rendered exactly as `32 cₙ³ dₙ³`, avoiding integer division.
- `pell`: the Pell identity `cₙ² − 2dₙ² = 1` (Lemma 3.1).
- `c_pos`, `d_nonneg`, `d_pos`, `c_lt`, `d_lt`: positivity and strict monotonicity of the sequences (Lemma 3.1).
- `solution`: the core algebraic identity `yₙ² + xₙ³ yₙ + zₙ² − 2 = 0`, holding for every `n` (Theorem 1.1 / Lemma 5.1, which packages the square-completion reduction of Lemma 2.1 and the identities of Lemmas 4.1–4.3).
- `xx_strictMono`: `n ↦ xₙ₊₁` is strictly monotone, ensuring the triples are pairwise distinct.
- `solutionSet` and `infinite_solutions`: the main result — the solution set `{(x,y,z) ∈ ℤ³ | y² + x³y + z² − 2 = 0}` is infinite, proved by injecting `n ↦ (xₙ₊₁, yₙ₊₁, zₙ₊₁)` into it.
The statement `infinite_solutions : solutionSet.Infinite` faithfully captures the paper's claim that the Diophantine equation has infinitely many integer solutions.
